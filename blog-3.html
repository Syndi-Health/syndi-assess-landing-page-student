                <h3 class="mt-5">The Frustrations of Depression</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    Depression. If I had to picture it, I would draw a beautiful landscape with a warm glowing sun….
                    coloured grey. I find that a part of depression that is often overlooked is the tremendous
                    frustration that comes with being in a situation that is supposed to be enjoyable, only to spend it
                    feeling down.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, I know this all too well, having at the age of 21 approached my university’s
                    healthcare centre for depression and being faced with a bunch of smiley faces on a piece of paper to
                    tick off as part of the diagnostic process, over-simplifying a much more complicated situation that
                    I was going through at the time. The result, a bunch of one-size-fits-all pills which were meant to
                    make the feelings stop similar to the way aspirin stops a headache. The reality, a brief spike in
                    serotonin making me feel ecstatic for a month or so before the normalisation of my surroundings made
                    everything turn grey again, this time with mandatory medication to go along with it. What was
                    supposed to be one of the most enjoyable years of my life went past in an apathetic blur, and the
                    worst part was that I blamed myself, felt alone and frustrated, trying helplessly to feel happy.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m not saying that the medication doesn’t work, to be approved by the medical system in the UK it
                    has had to be demonstrated as effective, it just didn’t work for me. As doctors become less personal
                    and we are treated by an overburdened healthcare system, there isn’t the time for a doctor to know
                    the intricacies of everyones’ life to provide personalised treatment for depression. The sad truth
                    is that depression is an extremely widespread condition, with more than 264 million people affected
                    worldwide, each person having their subjective wellbeing
                    playing a part. Does this mean that depression is a condition that can’t be tackled or that has to
                    be tackled alone? No, and that’s why I’d like to explain what has changed since I went to seek help
                    and why the future of treating depression is bright.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the App Store was released in 2008 with 500 apps, it has now grown to over 1.96 million, with
                    an estimated 10,000 focusing on mental health. You’re no longer
                    limited to a pill and a pamphlet handed out by your GP, you now have a plethora of digital
                    treatments right at your fingertips, such as cognitive behavioural principles, psycho-education,
                    symptom tracking tools, mindfulness apps, chatbots, goal setting apps and online support
                    communities. With so many treatments available to download, tackling depression should be
                    effortless, so why are we still unhappy? Well, the digitisation of treatment for depression is only
                    a small part of the solution. Unfortunately, most mental health apps suffer from terrible engagement
                    rates, naturally, as when you are depressed your motivation and attention can be severely reduced.
                    Sticking to plans and routines becomes difficult and with so many apps to choose from, the
                    overwhelming choice can be easy to give up on. Ultimately though, with a little guidance, there
                    should be the right combination for you. Maybe headspace doesn’t work for you, but having an app
                    that teaches you CBT, or reminds you to go for a morning walk, or an app that connects you to your
                    loved ones when you’re feeling down does.
                    <br><br>
                    For years I kept falling down a metaphorical hole into a state of depression, and initially, it
                    would take a long time to get out. Slowly, however, I learned to understand the situation I was in
                    and try different techniques to get out. There was a lot of trial and error, meditation didn’t work
                    for me for example. However, after some time, when I found myself in the hole it would take me less
                    time to recognise where I was, and eventually, after years of falling into the hole I built up a set
                    of techniques that allowed me to get out. With 50% of depression being chronic, understanding how to deal with it progressively is extremely
                    important. I wish I’d had the guidance and information available back then that I do now.
                    <br><br>
                    There is no silver bullet to cure depression, and this can be extremely frustrating. However, we
                    have more information and digital resources to deal with it than ever. After years of trying, I’ve
                    found what works for me, and I am now able to minimise the number of bad days I have. I can relate
                    to how hopeless advice can seem when you’re depressed, and my aim with this article is not to preach
                    some steps to a solution of what is a very personal illness. All I want to do is share my story, and
                    for those who are struggling, encourage them to stay hopeful and be patient, and try new techniques
                    where possible. Eventually, I hope, we will all be able to see the hole coming, and avoid it.
